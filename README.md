- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SgtBash
- ğŸ‘€ I am a hypnotherapist and  Iâ€™m interested in creating videos for my clinics website.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning EVERYTHING, (I am new to this. LOL)

<!---
Right now I am seeking a way to change Openshot to start my video creations at 00:00:00 as right now it always starts at 00:00:01 
Which I suspect is why when I mount a video om my website, it is just a black preview until you start the video.
There will likely be more issues I will need help with.
